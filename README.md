이 프로젝트는 [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 에서 땡겨(bootstrapped)왔습니다.

## 실행가능한 스크립트

해당 프로젝트에서 실행 가능한 스크립트 :

### `npm start`

개발 모드에서 실행합니다.<br>
해당 앱을 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) URL에서 기본 브라우저로 실행합니다.

수정하면 웹페이지가 리로드(갱신)됩니다.<br>
또한 콘솔창에 Lint 오류가 표시됩니다.

### `npm test`

대화식 모드에서 테스트를 시작합니다. <br>
자세한 내용은 다음 링크에서 확인 할 수 있습니다. [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
